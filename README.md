The project is to modify the given code and create functions and variables to make a thermostat. The board needed to check the buttons every 200ms, check the temp every 500 ms, updated the LED according the temp set, and report to the server every second using UART. 

I believe that I explain the project very well, and was able to write better comments in my code the more I understand what I am writing. It was starting to be the first thing I wrote before the code, and before it would be an after thought. 

I coudl improve my code skillset, there was a bug in my code i could not figure out. This was a difficult class for me and I think given enough time this is something I would be more interested in.

I was able to learn how to work with microcontrollers and the commmunciation betweeen devices. I believe that understanding can go a long way in any programming language. Also, using the comments.. which I always preach about.
